# Physics-Based-Animation & Fluid Simulation Engine
Projects and Resources on Physics (Physically) based animation

### Mostly referred to, visited and informative website on physics based animation:
* [Best collection and resource on Physics Based Animation](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com).

### Get started with [Raylib](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/3D_interactive_graphics_rendering_engine/blob/master/README.md#getting-started-with-developing-graphical-application-or-game-engine-with-raylib-has-very-good-c-bindings-as-base-library), which is a foundation library to build your own graphical application or game engine itself. Or, more well maintained and commercial grade C++ engine [G3D](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/3D_interactive_graphics_rendering_engine/blob/master/README.md#getting-started-with-developing-any-graphical-application-with-the-g3d-).

### Since the area is pretty big, GET STARTED WITH:
* **Physics based fluid simulation**.
* **Must have course at** Coursera on [Simulation and modeling of natural processes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modeling-simulation-natural-processes#syllabus). This course gives you an introduction to modeling methods and simulation tools for a wide range of natural phenomena. The different methodologies that will be presented here can be applied to very wide range of topics such as fluid motion, stellar dynamics, population evolution, ...
* **Another must have course on** Computer Graphics at Khan academy - [Pixar in a box](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar) from Pixar. Pixar in a Box is a behind-the-scenes look at how Pixar artists do their jobs. You will be able to animate bouncing balls, build a swarm of robots, and make virtual fireworks explode. The subjects you learn in school — math, science, computer science, and humanities — are used every day to create amazing movies at Pixar. This collaboration between Pixar Animation Studios and Khan Academy is sponsored by Disney.
* Book on [Fluid Engine Development](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org), explains how to create a fluid simulation engine from scratch. It's [documentation](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org/documentation/) and [github code link for the book](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev). **This book explains how to create a fluid simulation engine from scratch.**

## A beautiful book open sourced - for physically based rendering:
* Photorealistic computer graphics is ubiquitous today, with applications that include entertainment—notably, movies and video games; product design; and architecture. Donald Knuth wrote “This book has deservedly won an Academy Award. I believe it should also be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.” Read about the book [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/), which will link you to the contents of the book to [Physically Based Rendering:Contents](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html).
And more fun - here is the [source code used by the book](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3).

### Resources on Fluid Simulation:
* [SPlisHSPlasH is an open-source library for the physically-based simulation of fluids from RWTH Aachen](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH).
* [Publications on Physics based fluid simulation from RWTH Aachen](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0560_0559_0558_051_0555_0554_0549_054/).
* Worth mentioning twoice is [a nice resource website on physics based animation](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com) and its [recommended collection of books](http://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/books-2/).
* [Youtube : Physics based animation course videos from Ladislav Kavan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_a9tY9IhJuM2dIVCH_ZC0Pn5871eDY7_).
* [Physics simulation in computer graphics lab in ETH Zurich](https://graphics.ethz.ch/research/physics_simulation/) also [realted tutorials from ETH Zurich](https://graphics.ethz.ch/publications/tutorials.php) has lecture notes and pdf's.
